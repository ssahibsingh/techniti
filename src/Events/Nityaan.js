                NIT, Jalandhar is back with NITYAAN, catered to quench the
                thirst of rocket enthusiasm among school students in form of a
                competition. NITYAAN aims to sharpen the scientific skills of
                young minds for their brighter future. The event will initiate
                at around 2 PM on the 26th of February on the NITJ campus. This
                will also include the launching of 3 phenomenally designed, huge
                rockets from the institute’s side.

            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Round 1 Details:</h2>
            (a) For NITJ students, qualifier round to select 4 teams for the
            Integration Bee will be of the same format as the actual event and
            will be held on February 26th, 2023.
            <br />
            (b) The actual event will be conducted on February 27th, 2023 within
            the institute premises.
            <br />
            (c) The event consists of a six-round elimination tournament.
            Competitors face off in pairs, solving integrals at the blackboard.
            <br /> (d) Teams from different institutes will be pitched against
            one another based on a random draw.
            <br />
            (e) The integrals are projected onto a screen along with a timer.
            The integrals become more challenging as the contest progresses to
            higher rounds. <br />
            (f) When a team circles or boxes a solution, the clock is stopped,
            and the judges consider it. • If the solution is correct, the score
            of the team is incremented. • If the solution is incorrect, the
            clock resumes, and that team can no longer work on the integral,
            however the other team may do so in the remaining time and present a
            solution.
            <br />
            (g) If neither contestant gives a correct solution within the
            allotted time, both start with a new integral.
            <br />• Round of 32: First-to-one-integral elimination round. Time
            alloted is 1:30 minutes.
            <br /> • Round of 16: First-to-two-integrals elimination round. Time
            alloted is 2:00 minutes.
            <br />• Quarterfinals: First-to-two-integrals elimination round.
            Time alloted is 2:30 minutes.
            <br />• Semi-Finals: First-to-two-integrals elimination round. Time
            alloted is 3:00 minutes.
            <br />• The Final: First-to-three integrals wins the coveted ”Le
            grande Int´egrateur” title. Time alloted is 3:00 minutes.
            <br />
            3. Rules are subject to change without notice and may be amended as
