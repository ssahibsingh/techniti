                NITJ is back with NITYAAN, catered to quench the thirst of
                rocket enthusiasm among school students in form of a
                competition. NITYAAN aims to sharpen the scientific skills of
                young minds for their brighter future. The event will initiate
                at around 2 PM on the 26th of February on the NITJ campus. This
                will also include the launching of 3 phenomenally designed, huge
                rockets from the institute’s side.
